In Python, the available operators are:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition: +
   - Subtraction: -
   - Multiplication: *
   - Division: /
   - Modulus: %
   - Exponentiation: **
   - Floor division: //

2. Comparison Operators:
   - Equal: ==
   - Not equal: !=
   - Greater than: >
   - Less than: <
   - Greater than or equal to: >=
   - Less than or equal to: <=

3. Assignment Operators:
   - Assign: =
   - Add and assign: +=
   - Subtract and assign: -=
   - Multiply and assign: *=
   - Divide and assign: /=
   - Modulus and assign: %=
   - Exponentiate and assign: **=
   - Floor divide and assign: //=

4. Logical Operators:
   - And: and
   - Or: or
   - Not: not

5. Bitwise Operators:
   - And: &
   - Or: |
   - Not: ~
   - XOR: ^
   - Right shift: >>
   - Left shift: <<

6. Membership Operators:
   - In: in
   - Not in: not in

7. Identity Operators:
   - Is: is
   - Is not: is not

In Python, the equivalent of bash's [ if <esp> -eq <test>] do; is:

```python
if expression == test:
    do_something
```

Here, 'expression' is the condition you want to test, '==' is the comparison operator, and 'do_something' is the action you want to perform if the condition is true. Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks, unlike bash which uses 'do' and 'done'.
